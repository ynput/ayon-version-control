### __Detailed Info__ (optional)

   Externally version controlled files must be first copied locally to workspace area before they are committed to the version control server (like Perforce).

   Connect to Ayon server and set your local workspace folder in `ayon+settings://version_control:0.0.1/local_setting/workspace_dir`
